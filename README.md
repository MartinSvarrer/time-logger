# TimeLogger

Visma E-Commerce time logger task.

## Summary of Architectural Decisions

1. Use NX for scaffolding the application. NX is a great tool for scaling a repo to include multiple teams as it allows to run, build and test different parts of the repo independently.

# Getting Started

## Development server

- Run `npx nx serve time-logger` for a dev server
- Navigate to http://localhost:4200/.
- The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Understand this workspace

Run `npx nx graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of the projects.
